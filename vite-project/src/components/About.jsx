      <p>
        Hi, I'm Aswan Jay—a fullstack web developer passionate about building fast, secure, and visually engaging web experiences. I specialize in React, Vite, and Netlify, combining creative UI/UX with robust backend integrations powered by GraphQL APIs and Netlify Functions.

My projects feature responsive design, animated tags, filter icons, loading spinners, and semantic HTML—all optimized for performance and accessibility. I thrive on rapid iteration, clean Git workflows, and deploying live features in under 5 minutes.

Whether I'm debugging backend logic, refining CSS animations, or polishing README.md documentation, I bring energy, precision, and joy to every build. Let’s create something remarkable.
